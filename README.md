Programs and datasets for the work "Efficient Machine-learning-Aided Dynamics for Reactions with Post-Transition-State Bifurcation"
1. The Python programs for training the KRR models and the modified Progdyn for generating trajectories were placed in the KRRmodels.zip
2. Coulomb matrices, relative potential energies, and atomic forces for each dataset were placed in the datasets.zip
